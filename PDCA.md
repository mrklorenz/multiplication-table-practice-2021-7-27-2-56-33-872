1. createTable()
   P = , D = , C = , A =

2. isValid()
   P = 1 minute, D = 2 minutes 58 sec, C = , A = I need to familiarize simplifying codes/or functions that return boolean value.
   
3. isNumberInRange()
   P = 5 minutes, D = 3 minutes and 4 sec, C = , A = I should practice solving code smells. Because it slowed me on completing the function
   
4. isEndBiggerThanStart()
   P = 2 minutes, D = 54 sec, C = , A =
   
5. generateMultiplicationTable()
   P = , D = , C = , A =
   
6. generateMultiplicationLine()
   P = 5 minutes, D = 7 minutes 24 sec, C = Not using any String API and String manipulation, A = Should know more about String API and for loop
   
7. generateMultiplicationExpression()
   P = 5 minutes, D = 1 minute 25 sec, C = , A =
   
ACTIONS: 

1. Should learn more about String API and for loop
2. I should practice solving code smells. Because it slowed me on completing the function
3. I need to familiarize simplifying codes/or functions that return boolean value.
